[SDL] Force feedback joystick actuator patch

OK, I've got it all working perfectly now.  It has been tested on
PS2Linux and my pc a little too. (patch is attached)

Included in this patch:
2003-03-07
 * Force feedback actuator API for SDL:
    SDL_JoystickNumActuators();
    SDL_JoystickSetActuator();
    SDL_JoystickGetActuatorType();
    SDL_JoystickGetActuatorRange();

 * PS2Linux native joystick module - supporting plain digital, Analog
   and DualShock 1/2 controllers.

 * PS2Linux implementation of force feedback API.

 * Other joystick modules patched with dummy functions to work with the
   new API.

 * testactuator.c created to test the actuator API and the PS2Linux
   implementation.

 * testjoysticktext.c created to test the joystick in text mode.

 * testjoystick.c modifed to return info about the actuators on the device.

 * testjoystick.c added extra argv[2] to select the analog stick other
   than 0.

 * testjoystick.c modified to avoid analog stick display going off the
   edge of screen (overscan issue).

 * added startup printf usage help to testjoystick, and aditional
   programs by myself.

 * configure.in and PS2Linux makefile.am patched to support the new
   features.

 * added extra generated filenames to .cvsignore (so that "diff -X
   SDL12/.cvsignore" provides clean output).

 * renamed several "Playstation 2" comments to "PS2Linux in
   configure.in (for clarity, because I have been doing some native PS2).


It has been great fun implementing all of this.  Now it would be great
if more platforms were supported by this API addition.  If someone else
with a force feedback joystick can code up another platform module this
would be great.

I am on ICQ 11122941 if anyone uses ICQ at all.
