  <title>SDL Force Feedback Joystick Actuator Support</title>

<h2>SDL Force Feedback Actuator API Addition by J. Grant.</h2>
<br>
I implemented a native SDL module that accessed the joystick using the
PS2Linux  ps2pad.o kernel module.&nbsp; Normally the linux kernel
joystick API would have been used instead.&nbsp; Using the ps2pad
kernel module allowed for force feedback actuator support; which I have
added to the SDL Joystick API.<br>
<br>
I modified the SDL autoconf and automake configuration to support the
new features I added.&nbsp; In addition to this I added two test
programs to the test suite. testactuator.c and a testjoysticktest.c
(based on graphical testjoystick.c).<br>
<br>
I implemented the API and source code in a cross platform abstract way,
so hopefully others will add force feedback actuator support to other
joystick modules in SDL.<br>
